How to run individual Differential applications: Stand in project folder

python -m DifferentialApplication.name

ex:
python -m DifferentialApplication.Binary1D

This is the same system for running any file, such as experiments, utils or query.

python -m foldername.filename





Folders:
data - all data used by the applications and utilities.
DifferentialApplication: The different DifferenetialApplications
experiments: experiments on differing aspects of the implementation
Mechanisms: implementations of differentially private mechanisms
Queris - simple query modules
results - folder tha tresults of running anything ends in, apart from dataExtractor, as this saves to data.
utils - helping modules and different utilities.
